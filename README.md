# Marvel Quiz
Marvel Quiz is a fun interactive trivia quiz that tests the players knowledge about all things marvel. The quiz consists of 3 difficulties with different questions. I recommend starting with the easy questions and working your way up from there. These quiz questions are based off the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and some of them might stump even the most devoted marvel fans!

Think you know everything there is to know about the MCU? Let's see how close you were really paying attention to the 32 (and counting) movies that have been released so far! Have a go at the quiz and lets see how you do!

## UI/UX

### Design Overview
For the design of the quiz, I wanted something that was interesting and fun to look at whilst also retaining a common theme. The site has a main background image consisting of well-known Marvel characters in front of a stylistic blue background. This image frames the main content well, and I find, is interesting for the player to look at. The secondary background is for the quiz content. This background consists of a patterned red image that contrasts well with the blue of the main background.

the same red background is used for all quiz content, staying with the same theme throughout. All of the Main text content uses a font called 'Poppins', which is pleasant to look at, easy to read and is relatively close to the font used in the official Marvel Logo. All of the buttons for the quiz are an off-white colour with black text. This allows the buttons to be easily distinguished from the backgroud as well as easily read by the player.

Again, this button style theme is kept consistant throughout the quiz with small variations in size. Outside of the quiz content is the main quiz heading and the main quiz home button. The heading is centered in the viewport and styled to look similar to the Marvel logo. The home button is a home icon that is in the same red and white stye as the rest of the quiz elements. Both of these elements will always be shown and can be accessed as they are fixed and will not change when navigating the quiz.

### Colour Scheme
Marvel traditionally tend to use very bright and bold colours. As the background is already very vibrant, colourful and active, the quiz uses quite a simple colour palette as not too over-stimulate the player with a plethora of different colours. A deep red and off white colours were used interchangeably for backgrounds and outlines. If text is on a red background, it is set to off-white. If text is on a white background, it is set to black. 

Generally, white text is for headings and black text is for buttons. This increases the readability for the user. The deep red colour is applied to main button text using hover effects. This black, red and white colour Scheme is used throughout the quiz and contrasts well with the blue of the main quiz background. There are two separate colour schemes used for the correct and incorrect styles set for the answer buttons after the user selects and option. The HEX codes and colour palettes can be seen below!
