# Marvel Quiz
Marvel Quiz is a fun interactive trivia quiz that tests the players knowledge about all things marvel. The quiz consists of 3 difficulties with different questions. I recommend starting with the easy questions and working your way up from there. These quiz questions are based off the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and some of them might stump even the most devoted marvel fans!

Think you know everything there is to know about the MCU? Let's see how close you were really paying attention to the 32 (and counting) movies that have been released so far! Have a go at the quiz and lets see how you do!
